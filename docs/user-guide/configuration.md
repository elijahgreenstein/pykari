title: Project Configuration
---

The `_pykari.yaml` file provides configuration for a Pykari project. The default configuration file created with `pykari --setup` is:

```yaml
build: _build
ignore:
- _build
source: .
static_ext:
- .css
- .js
- .jpg
- .png
```

# Settings

`build`
: The directory for the site files generated by Pykari. Default: `_build`.

`ignore`
: A list of directories in the source directory that Pykari should ignore. Pykari will not generate build files from files in the listed directory. Default: `_build`.

`source`
: The source directory. Pykari will look for Markdown files with the "`.md`" extension in the source directory and all subdirectories, except those listed under `ignore`. Default: the project root directory (`.`).

`static_ext`
: A list of extensions of static files that Pykari will copy from the `static` subdirectory in `source` to the `static` subdirectory in `build`. Defaults: CSS style sheets, JavaScript scripts, and JPG and PNG images.
